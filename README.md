A sample Stripe Connect integration

## Friction Log
I am assuming the persona of a startup's technical co-founder, one who can code, looking to integrate with a payment gateway for processing transactions on his platform app. The app I'm building is an online shopping marketplace which connects artisans building customized home decor with local consumers. Consumers will make payments to my platform app for items they wish to purchase. My app will take a small fixed percentage fee and relay the remaining payment to the artisan.

I've heard great things about Stripe so I log on to the website(https://stripe.com/) to check it out.

### Website Landing
My initial thoughts are highly positive. I see the one-liner on Stripe mentions "*..startups..use Stripe.. to accept payments, send payouts, and manage their businesses online*", which encourages me. 
I like seeing the "Start now" button which provides me a good place to start - I know I have to come back to this. 
Scrolling down and seeing the logos of Instacart and Shopify provides me further confidence that Stripe would work for me.

Scrolling further down, I notice an image showing a graph of declining dispute rates. As an enthusiastic startup co-founder, I hadn't thought about having to manage disputes while conducting business but it's good to see that Stripe's got it covered.

### Trying 'Start Now'
I click on 'Start Now' and land on the Sign Up page. Seeing 'marketplaces' under "Support any business model" reaffirms my faith that Stripe will work.

The Sign Up is simple and easy. It makes sense that email, password, full name and country were asked - nothing out of the blue.
